My project is called Interactive Avatar. It shows a face/potato and users click the screen to make the potato wink.
I made this project for the Girls Who Code program.
I started this project using the starter code in the Girls Who Code program. From there, I watched videos on the steps to make our avatar. Once it was finished, I was challenged to make the avatar blink, wink, and close its mouth when clicked.
I struggled making it wink and close its mouth when clicked. Turns out it was the conditional and function making the error. I learned how to make functions in this project and to make sure conditionals are responding (using print() in cases of debugging).[![Athena Award Badge](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Faward.athena.hackclub.com%2Fapi%2Fbadge)](https://award.athena.hackclub.com?utm_source=readme)
